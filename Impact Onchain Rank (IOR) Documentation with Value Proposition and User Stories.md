# Impact Onchain Rank (IOR) Documentation

## Introduction
Impact Onchain Rank (IOR) is a novel metric that quantifies and rewards the contributions of individuals and organizations to impactful causes via Impact NFTs (INFTs).

## Value Propositions

### For Contributors
- **Recognition of Impact**: IOR acknowledges your contributions to impactful causes, providing a tangible measure of your positive influence.
- **Incentives for Contribution**: Higher ranks unlock exclusive rewards, motivating continued support for various causes.

### For the Community
- **Fostering a Culture of Impact**: Encourages a competitive yet collaborative atmosphere among contributors, aiming to maximize collective impact.
- **Transparency and Accountability**: Offers a transparent system for tracking and recognizing contributions, building trust within the community.

## User Stories

### Sarah's Story
Sarah, an avid supporter of environmental causes, actively purchases Impact NFTs to support reforestation projects. Her consistent contributions increase her IOR, granting her access to exclusive community events and recognition.

### Alex's Achievement
Alex leverages his high IOR to influence new environmental campaigns on the platform. His rank allows him to participate in decision-making processes, choosing which projects receive funding next.

## How It Works
1. **Earn IV by Contributing**: Purchase INFTs to support causes and accumulate Impact Value (IV).
2. **Increase Your Rank**: Your IOR increases as you accumulate more IV, reflecting your growing contribution.
3. **Unlock Rewards**: Gain access to various benefits as your IOR rises, including early access to new INFTs and exclusive community recognitions.
